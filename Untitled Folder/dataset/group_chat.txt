03/07/22, 7:15 pm - Poonam Mam: Greetings!,

We in Thakur College of Science and Commerce believe that college life is more than just getting good grades but also enjoying this time and learning social skills beyond our textbooks. However, in the past two years, we have been restricted to our homes, so this year, we will be striving to re-ignite the lost tradition of celebrating fresh new faces with a fresher’s party. Especially for the batches that barely got to know the true essence of college life, this is our golden shot to re-learn collaborative fervour and restart a cycle of giving.

So we welcome your support to kindle *Genesis 2K22: Freshers of the Department of I.T. & D.S.* Our theme for this year will be RETRO.

*We would request everyone to provide a nominal contribution of Rs 300 and submit it to your CRs within the next week.*

_Note: The CRs will collect the fund, maintain a record of payments and submit it to their respective class teachers._
04/07/22, 8:05 am - Poonam Mam: Whenever he is on a screen, he rules it⚡️ Whatever he does, our eyes are glued to it. With his skills and charisma, he manages to bag our appreciation with each performance he puts out, he is none other than Rajkumar Rao😍💫

One of the most talented actors our Hindi film industry has seen. He has made his mark in the industry with some incredible films like 'Kai Po Che' 'Trapped' and 'Badhai Do' and is now back with another promising film 'HIT: The first case'😍

Team Taarangan is beyond excited to have him at this year's theme launch. Witness his presence on the TCSC Campus at 12pm on 4th July, Monday!❤️✨

Talent recognises talent so we got the reel life Shinchan on the judge panel 👩‍⚖

Nisman is a relatable, funny content creater who started her journey in 2020. Her quirky personality can be very entertaining as you can clearly see in her videos.

She also had the opportunity to witness the Roadies finale shoot which was being held in South Africa, the opportunity to host her own digital show as well as an opportunity to host a Roadies after-hour digital show. 
She's as fun as it gets, here's @niswoman with us to make this event a more fun and entertaining one!

As you all know after covid🦠, we never really got the opportunity to spend time together, college events, coming to class, are regulars, and even while we had a short IV in FY, many have yet to experience it. This time the location is calling for togetherness🌄🏞️, the opportunity to getting to know each other better, to spend some quality time with each other…which will eventually go down in the book of our minds…known as MEMORIES…which is something we all will cherish forever💫. College day memories are those memories that will always bring a smile on your face, every time you look back and think about them.

The location as y’all already know, will be Manali🏔️, the trip will be in December, honestly the best combo of destination and weather.❄️☃️

19/01/23, 7:55 pm - Sherilyn Mam: We as humans owe it to our planet to make a positive impact and create a healthier future and e-waste being extremely toxic and not very biodegradable, e-waste can have a resounding negative impact on our environment.
So the next PR activity for our contingent is “E-waste collection and proper disposal of the same” in association with the EVS and FC Department - bring any e-waste you might have to your respective classes on the 20th and 21st of January (Friday and Saturday)
This could include old and worn out batteries, mobile phones, remotes, toys, toasters, hard drives, DVDs etc.
This activity has points as well so let’s come together to bring our department to the top and initiaite a wave and pledge to donate any small contribution with a donation of the e-waste accumulating in our houses. We ourselves will be coming to your classes and collecting the e waste from you guys...

Thank you for making my time at this college such a positive and rewarding experience. I wish you all the best for your future studies and beyond.

Take care and stay in touch,
